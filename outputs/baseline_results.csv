# Baseline Comparison Results (Table 1)
# TACL 2025: Speaker-normalized Acoustic Distance for Japanese Pitch Accent
#
# Tarui Rate: Classification frequency (higher = more Tarui assignments)
# Balance Ratio: Tarui/Kansai distance ratio (1.0 = balanced discrimination)
# Assessment: Collapse (<10% or ratio>1.2), Over-assign (>80%), Preserved (15-80% with ratio~1.0)
